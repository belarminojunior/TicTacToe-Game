## About the Project

This project implements a classic TicTacToe game with a graphical user interface (GUI) using Java Swing. Players can take turns to make their moves on a 3x3 grid, and the game declares a winner when a player forms a line horizontally, vertically, or diagonally. The game also detects a draw when all cells are filled.
